1.

$f_n = f_0+f_1x+f_2x^2+f_3x^3...+f_nx^n$

$-8xf_n = 0-8f_0x-8f_1x^2-8f_2x^3-8f_3x^4...-8f_{n-1}x^n$

$-\sum_n4^nx^n=-1-4x-4^2x^2-4^3x^3...-4^nx^n$

By adding them together:

$(1-8x)f_n = -\sum_n4^nx^n$

$$f_n = \frac{1}{{(1-4x)}*{(1-8x)}} = \frac{c_1}{(1-4x)}+\frac{c_2}{(1-8x)}$$

$c_1+c_2=1,8c_1+4c_2=0$,solve them => $c_1=-1,c_2=2$

$$\frac{-1}{(1-4x)}+\frac{2}{(1-8x)}$$
$$\sum_n{-1*4^n}x^n+\sum_n2*8^nx^n=\sum_n{(-1*4^n+2*8^n)}*x^n$$

Thus $f_n =(-1*4^n+2*8^n)$ 

2.

$p(n)=c*4^n$

$c*4^n=7c*4^{n-1}+\frac{18}{4}*4^n$

$4^{n-1}*(-3c-18)=0$ . Thus $c = - 6$.The particular solution is $(-6)*4^n$

We also find a solution to $g_n=c7^n$.The function should be $g_n=c7^n+(-6)*4^n$

Now plug  $g_0=1$,we get $1=c-6 => c = 7$,thus the solution to the original function is $$g_n=7^{n+1}+(-6)*4^n$$

3.
Divide and Conquer:
Assume the initial size is n, and any further size becomes $n/(2^n)$,since it is a divide and conquer algorithm, its size decrease by half.We have formula $$f_n = (-1*4^n+2*8^n)$$ according to 1.Since $N=2^n$,$$f_n = (-1*N^2+2*N^3)$$, as N can be as large as infinity,discarding all these constant and leave the term with highest power, we conclude this algorithm has a complexity of $N^3$.\\

Strassenâ€™s Algorithm:
According to 2.$g_n=7^{n+1}+(-6)*4^n$ 

$g_n=7*7^n+(-6)*N^2$,and also we observe that $7^n = (2^n)^{log_27}$.Hence it is $$g_n=7*N^{log_27}+(-6)*N^2$$.By discarding constants and choosing the highest power term, we get the complexity for this one ,which is $N^{log_27}$.
